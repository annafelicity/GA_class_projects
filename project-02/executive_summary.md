Executive Summary of Iowa Liquor Data

Alcohol consumption in the state of Iowa is impressive in terms of quantity. It is also interesting because while certain types of alcohol (whiskies and related liquor like scotch and bourbon as well as vodka) jump out as of great popularity in most, if not all places, there are some apparent regional variations in preference for type of alcohol.

With respect to further exploration, I think it would be interesting to pull subsets of data that just contain the three top liquors consumed in each county--that would be managable to look at, as there are 99 counties, and would reveal trends. I'd like to map the most popular liquor by county on a geographical map to see if there are geographical trends--or if preference is scattered across the region in no particular order.

It would also be interesting to compare alcohol preferences in major cities.

As I mentioned in my results document, the categorizer function I made is not perfect, and needs some fine tuning (e.g. my sloe gin not actually being a gin example).
