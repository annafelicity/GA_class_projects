** This repository contains the work I did for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive Bootcamp in February to April of 2017.

Each README in the project directories is the original prompt for the weekend's assignment (each assignment corresponds to the previous week's lessons). All the other files in each directory are my own code, with the exception of a handful of prompts within some of the Jupyter notebooks that were there to get us started.
